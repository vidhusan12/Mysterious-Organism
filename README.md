# Pila Aequor DNA Simulator ðŸ§¬

## Description
This project simulates the DNA of *Pila aequor* (P. aequor), a newly discovered deep-sea organism found near hydrothermal vents. 
Due to its rapid mutations and inability to survive above sea level, studying it in the lab is challenging. 
This simulation allows researchers to analyze its DNA structure and mutation patterns efficiently.

## Features
- Generates *P. aequor* DNA sequences with 15 bases.
- Simulates mutations to study genetic variations.
- Compares DNA sequences for similarity.
- Determines if a DNA sequence is likely to survive in its environment.
